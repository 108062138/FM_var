> by popo
## abstract
- This project aims to solve the partition problem in the EDA class. The target is to partition a big circuit such that their cur is minimized. 
## how to run this project
- type `chmod 777 run.sh` to enable the the shell script in the current working directory
- type `./run.sh` to run the project. 
## progress
- There are two levels at this project. They are the basic part and the bonus part. The basic part just requires us to partition the circuit into half, while the bonus part needs k-way partition. I fails to achieve the bonus part.
